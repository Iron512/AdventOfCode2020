# Advent Of Code 2020

Here we are, Advent of Code 2020 just begun.
Actually i actively partecipated only the one of 2015 i guess, while i was studying C++ for my uni exams. That year i didn't even closed it! Now im back on track and I'm prone to finish it all. 

I was thinking about set a branch a day, but honestly that's useless and tedious to use. A standard group of folders will do. 

**CUSTOM RULE: each day a different programming language will be used. *Languages might be reused in different days*** 

## Achivements and fun facts
If I ever achieve something interesting during this adventure, i will write it down here.
- Fully powered by linux. Shouldn't be an achivement, but i heard of people that still code on Windows.
- On the first challenge I listened for 43 minutes the same song (Pumped up kick by *Foster the People*) without noticing. Special thanks to youtube 1hr loop song. Couldn't expect a better start.
