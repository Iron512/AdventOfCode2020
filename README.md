# Advent Of Code 2020

Here we are, Advent of Code 2020 just begun.
Actually i actively partecipated only the one of 2015 i guess, while i was studying C++ for my uni exams. That year i didn't even closed it! Now im back on track and I'm prone to finish it all. 

I was thinking about set a branch a day, but honestly that's useless and tedious to use. A standard group of folders will do. 

**CUSTOM RULE: each day a different programming language will be used. *Languages might be reused in different days*** 

## Achivements and fun facts
If I ever achieve something interesting during this adventure, i will write it down here.
- Fully powered by linux. Shouldn't be an achivement, but i heard of people that still code on Windows.
- On the first challenge I listened for 43 minutes the same song (Pumped up kick by *Foster the People*) without noticing. Special thanks to youtube 1hr loop song. Couldn't expect a better start.
- On day four the most complex part is carried out through regex. Even as a programmer I never thought that i would actively need to use them. I'm positively astonished.
- On day five, i solved both problem using and algorithm bound to the input size. Super proud, studying ASD was really worth, after all (i.e O(N))
- I solved in 37 min the first task of **Day Six** (48 mins for both task) using Go, which i never ever had used. I learned it from scratch in this occasion. Kinda proud.
- On day seven I saw the input and the job is kinda interesting. However I'm definitely going to bed, is 9:50PM (which is lot earlier than the usual 1:00AM). I was on the snow all day, the track was awesome and i did lot of powder. Actually the achivement are two: "missed day after neither a week" and "being able to survive a full sporty day". I just wanted to push this info
