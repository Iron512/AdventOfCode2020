# FIRST DAY
The language chosen is C++, as you might have been understood.
This language is really close to me, and i wanted to start with it, since i discovered Advent of Code while studying for my C++ exam.
This is kinda a return to the origins, for me.

## Running the code
``` sh
> g++ main_1.cc -o marco
> ./marco input.txt 2020
```
```sh
> g++ main_2.cc -o marco
> ./marco input.txt 2020
```
