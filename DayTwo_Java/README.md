# SECOND DAY
Today i opted for Java. I am not a master, but i feel pretty confident using most of the data structure provided.
Altough there could be better possibilities, is one of my favourites **high level** programming languages.


## Running the code
*If some JRE (the lastest if possible) is installed*
``` sh
> java main.java input.txt
```

The code will provide both solutions.
