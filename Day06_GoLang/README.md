# SIXTH DAY
New day new challenge. After supersuccesfully solving yesterday's puzzle, with an optimal algorithm, I'm positive to be able to solve this one using a language that i never played with. This type of challenge will probably be common in the next days, as the set of languages i deeply know is not that wide. I chose GoLang, and i will take my time from the reading of the puzzle input to the end of the second part, just to see if i am a worth programmer or not (*Spoiler: I am not, but don't tell anybody*).

## Milestones
- 09:46AM launched `$ sudo pacman -Syu go`. Clearly adding that little `u` was one of the biggest mistakes of my life.
- 10:04AM luckily not that many packets had to be updated. Go is ready to go.
- 10:41AM I successfully completed the first problem, It took me 37 minutes to go from an unknown language to solving a medium complexity problem with it. I'm kinda proud.
- 10:52AM In this 11 minutes i modified the code to produce the results for the second problem given 

## Running the code
*If some Go compiler (the lastest if possible) is installed*
``` sh
> go build main_1.go
> ./main_1 input.txt
```
``` sh
> go build main_2.go
> ./main_2 input.txt
```

## Takeouts

Go is definetly a powerful language, I just tasted a little bit of it, but i can definitely tell it. The freedom degree that gives to the management of arrays or complex data structure, or the management of the assignation can really help out developer. I hated the fact that i can't declare a value without using it, which makes sense obv, but sometimes it is imho stricter than needed (during development).
