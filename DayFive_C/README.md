# FIRST DAY
As I promised (to who, really?) yesterday, I will solve this problem using plain C.
I still have to see the puzzle input, hoping that is not to shitty to be treated with C, but as a bonus personal goal, i won't use any library different from `<stdio.h>`

## Running the code
``` sh
> gcc main_1.c -o pitri
> ./pitri input.txt 
```
```sh
> gcc main_2.c -o pitri
> ./pitri input.txt
```
