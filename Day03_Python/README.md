# THIRD DAY
This it python turn. I am still doing things in python as i would in any other procedural programming language.
I know I could be a lot faster and shorter writing this language, but I'm still getting used to it :)
Programming in python always feels like cheating

## Running the code
*If python3 is installed*
``` sh
> python3 main.py input.txt
```

The code will provide both solutions.
