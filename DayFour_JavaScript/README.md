# FIRST DAY
Today i wanted to go something low, like C. Then i saw the puzzle input... and i couldn't choose something different from Javascript.
Tomorrow i promise that no matter the input i will go soaking wet (working at C level, big classic).

## Running the code
*Provided you have some node installed on you machine*
``` sh
> node main.js input.txt
```

The code contains both solutions.
